**Firewall**: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## G

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: A comprehensive data privacy law in the EU that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.

## H

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: A protocol for secure communication over a computer network, encrypting the data exchanged between your browser and the website.

**Hardware security key**: A physical device used for two-factor authentication that helps protect against phishing and account takeovers.

## I

**IP address**: A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, which can reveal your approximate location and internet service provider.

**IMSI catcher**: A device used for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking location data by mimicking a cell tower.

## J

**JavaScript**: A programming language commonly used on websites that can be both beneficial for functionality and problematic for privacy if used to track users.

## K

**Key (cryptographic)**: A piece of information used in encryption algorithms to convert plain text into cipher text and vice versa.

**Keylogger**: Software or hardware that records keystrokes on a device, often used maliciously to capture sensitive information like passwords.

## L

**Local storage**: A web storage option that stores data with no expiration date on a user's device, which can be used for legitimate purposes or for tracking.

## M

**Metadata**: Data that provides information about other data, such as the time a message was sent or the location where a photo was taken.

**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: An authentication method requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, enhancing security.

**Man-in-the-middle attack**: An attack where a malicious actor secretly relays and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

## N

**Network analysis**: The process of intercepting and examining messages to deduce information from patterns in communication, even when the content is encrypted.

## O

**OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context, often revealing more personal information than users realize.

**OTR (Off-the-Record)**: A cryptographic protocol that provides encryption for instant messaging conversations, allowing for deniability.

**Opt-out**: The process by which individuals can request that their information not be collected, used, or shared by a company.

## P

**PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**: An encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.

**Phishing**: A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.

**Privacy by design**: An approach to systems engineering that takes privacy into account throughout the whole engineering process.

**Proxy server**: An intermediary server that requests resources on behalf of a client from another server, potentially masking the client's identity.

## Q

**Quantum computing**: An emerging technology that could potentially break many of the cryptographic systems currently in use, posing future privacy challenges.

## R

**Redaction**: The process of editing a document to remove or censor sensitive information before publication or sharing.

**Right to be forgotten**: A concept that allows individuals to request that their personal data be removed from Internet searches and other directories under certain conditions.

## S

**Secure messaging**: Communication platforms that prioritize the privacy and security of messages, often incorporating encryption and other security features.

**Signal protocol**: A non-federated cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging, used in various messaging applications.

**SSH (Secure Shell)**: A cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

**Self-hosted**: Services or applications that users run on their own servers rather than relying on third-party providers, potentially increasing privacy and control.

**SSL/TLS**: Cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network, the foundation of HTTPS.

## T

**Tor (The Onion Router)**: Software for enabling anonymous communication by directing Internet traffic through a worldwide overlay network to conceal a user's location and usage.

**Tracker blocker**: Software that prevents websites and third parties from collecting information about your online activities.

**Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: A security process requiring users to provide two different authentication factors, increasing security compared to single-factor authentication.

## U

**Usage data**: Information collected about how a user interacts with a service or application, which can be used for improving the service or for tracking.

## V

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A service that encrypts your internet connection and disguises your online identity, providing privacy and enhanced security when using public networks.

**Vendor lock-in**: A situation where a customer becomes dependent on a vendor's products or services and cannot easily switch to another vendor without substantial costs or inconvenience.

## W
